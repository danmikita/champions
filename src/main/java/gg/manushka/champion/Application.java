/**
 * @SpringBootApplication is a convenience annotation that adds all of the following:
 * @Configuration tags the class as a source of bean definitions for the application context.
 * @EnableAutoConfiguration tells Spring Boot to start adding beans based on classpath settings,
 * other beans, and various property settings.
 * Normally you would add @EnableWebMvc for a Spring MVC app, but Spring Boot adds it automatically
 * when it sees spring-webmvc on the classpath. This flags the application as a web application and
 * activates key behaviors such as setting up a DispatcherServlet.
 * @ComponentScan tells Spring to look for other components, configurations, and services in the the
 * current and sub-packages, allowing it to find the controllers.
 * The main() method uses Spring Bootâ€™s SpringApplication.run() method to launch an application.
